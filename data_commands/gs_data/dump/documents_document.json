        "abstract_en": "This report describes the ISC-GEM Global Instrumental Earthquake Catalogue (1900-2009) created on the request and with sponsorship from the GEM Foundation.\r\n\uf0b7 The ISC-GEM Global Instrumental Earthquake Catalogue (1900-2009) is a major step forward on the way to improve characterization of spatial distribution of seismicity, magnitude frequency relation and maximum magnitudes within the scope of GEM.\r\n\uf0b7 With a few exceptions, parameters of this catalogue are the result of computations based on the original reports of seismic stations and observatories.\r\n\uf0b7 We made every effort to use uniform location and magnitude determination procedures during the entire period of the catalogue:\r\n- In earthquake location, we used a combination of the EHB depth determination technique and the new ISC procedures that use a multitude of primary and secondary seismic phases from the IASPEI Seismic Phase List and the ak135 velocity model and take into account the correlated error structure.\r\n- In determination of earthquake magnitude, where possible, we used direct MW values from Global CMT project for the period 1976-2009. In addition, 1,127 high quality scientific papers have been processed to obtain directly measured values of M0 and MW for 970 large earthquakes during 1900-1979. In all other instances we computed MW proxy values based on our own determination of instrumental surface or body wave magnitudes using updated regression models.\r\n- It has to be noted that a computation of MW proxy values based on regressions from other types of magnitudes does not bring similarly reliable results as compared to a direct measurement of MW based on the original waveform analysis. It is, nevertheless, a necessary measure since the direct measurement of MW using historical analogue waveforms on a global scale is beyond the scope of this project.\r\n\uf0b7 A number of important additional benefits have been achieved during this project:\r\n- The entire ISC collection of historical paper-based seismic station bulletins was reviewed, indexed and catalogued for further works. Indexes of similar collections at USGS/Berkeley were used in filling the gaps in the ISC collection.\r\n- A large number of seismic phase arrival times, body and surface wave amplitude measurements have been made electronically available on a global scale that have never been available on a global scale prior to this project.\r\n- A large number of more accurate network MS and mb magnitudes have been computed for large earthquakes that either had no magnitude estimate or the estimates were previously based on single or unreliable station data.\r\n\uf0b7 In our work we consulted and were observed by experts from the IASPEI and, where possible, followed the IASPEI seismic standards.\r\n\uf0b7 We put together an excellent team of professionals in the field and gave training to a group of technical personnel without whom the work on this project would have been impossible to complete. These personnel members are a valuable asset of this project and their experience can be used if further work was to be planned.\r\n\uf0b7 Although the ISC-GEM Catalogue is a major accomplishment, we nevertheless believe that further work is necessary to enhance its qualities:\r\n- Firstly, neglecting to update the ISC-GEM Catalogue beyond 2009 would seriously hamper the GEM community efforts of testing and refining of the earthquake forecasting models.\r\n- Secondly, it is well known that in seismic hazard studies the effect of small to moderate size earthquakes is not negligible. This is especially the case in densely populated and industrialized areas. This calls for further improvement of completeness of the reference catalogue to be extensively used by GEM community for many years to come.\r\n- Thirdly, it has to be noted that we really have no magnitude estimates for many events in our main original source of historical data before 1964 \u2013 the ISS Catalog. Some of these events in the first part of the 20th century could be large enough to have caused damage. The work of including many more earthquakes recorded at teleseismic distances and bringing previously unavailable station amplitude data from historical station bulletins would greatly contribute to more accurate consequent analysis of global earthquake hazard and risk.",

        "abstract_en": "In one sense, all seismology is the study of historical earthquakes. Earthquakes are short-lived phenomena; over within a couple of minutes at most, well before the seismologist can arrive on the scene. Every earthquake is history, albeit recent history, by the time it can be studied.\r\nThis inability to observe an earthquake in real time has coloured the development of seismology as a science. In lieu of direct observation, scientists have been obliged to rely on secondary phenomena, or to put it another way, on traces left by the earthquake. These can be grouped into three: permanent marks left on the landscape, written descriptions of the effects of an earthquake, and the recordings made by instruments specifically designed to register the movement of the ground during an earthquake. These three different types of data are the three pillars on which seismological knowledge rests.\r\nThe relative importance of these three data types in reconstructing the patterns of global seismicity varies over time. For the 20th century, instrumental data is the richest source of information on which a catalogue of earthquakes can be built. Before the 20th century, written descriptions take over as the primary data source, back as far as written history goes, after which geological data is the source of information for earthquakes in prehistoric time.\r\nIt should be no surprise then, to someone introduced to the work of the Global Earthquake Model (GEM), to find three major subprojects on geological data (Faulted Earth), on historical information (Global Earthquake History), and instrumental data (Instrumental Earthquake Catalogue). This report is the output of two years of activity in the second of these, the Global Earthquake History (GEH).\r\nThe study of earthquakes from historical sources, or historical seismology, was for many decades of the 20th century a neglected subject. It seemed to many seismologists of the period that all necessary information could be obtained from seismometers. The impulse to treat historical seismology more seriously came from the development of seismic hazard studies, beginning in the 1970s, when it was realised that understanding of earthquake recurrence required a longer time history than instrumental data could provide. The difficulty has been (and this is true of the period before 1970 as well) that the impulse to study historical earthquakes has come from seismologists, who naturally are trained in the physical sciences, whereas the study of historical records requires expertise from the social sciences. Many blunders have been committed in the past by physics-trained seismologists misinterpreting documents through a lack of the skills of the historian.\r\nThe solution has been to recruit some seismologists with a social sciences background, and to interact directly with the community of professional historians. This has been facilitated in Europe by a series of international projects funded by the EU, which, by bringing together the specialists from different European countries, have strengthened links, and allowed the development of a mutually-supporting community of experts across the continent. In these projects, INGV has played a leading role, unsurprisingly given that Italy is the most seismically active country with the richest history in Europe. GEH exploits in a large degree the expertise gained in European projects over the last 25 years.\r\nElsewhere in the world, the situation varies greatly, both in terms of the amount and types of material available for study, and the effort, past and present, put into retrieving and exploiting it. A global synthesis of the pre- 20th century earthquake history of the world is therefore a huge challenge. In compiling an instrumental\r\nearthquake catalogue, one can take advantage of the fact that the basic materials, seismograms and bulletins, are international in nature, easily accessed and interpreted. A historical catalogue faces the problem that basic source materials are scattered and obscure, and in a plethora of different languages and scripts, while existing secondary studies vary hugely in quality and organisation. In some parts of the world it is easy to identify local experts with whom one can collaborate, in other places these do not even exist.\r\nWith these constraints, a circumspect approach to GEH was necessary. The project has therefore been conceived in such a way as to provide both a snapshot of the status quo of historical seismology as it exists today across the globe, and also a framework for future initiatives, that will support further work to improve understanding of historical seismicity (much needed in some regions).\r\nThe project is thus structured around three complementary deliverables: archive, catalogue and infrastructure.\r\nThe Global Historical Earthquake Archive (GHEA) is the most important of the three, in providing a complete (so far as is possible) account of the global situation in historical seismology, with all existing studies of historical earthquakes collected together in a syncretised way, retrievable either by earthquake or region. It is truly a global survey of historical seismology as it exists at present.\r\nThe Global Historical Earthquake Catalogue (GHEC) is a world catalogue of earthquakes for the period 1000- 1903, with magnitude 7 Mw and over (less in some regions), derived from GHEA by a process of comparing the sets of parameters available for each earthquake and selecting the best-attested. This delivers to GEM the most comprehensive global historical catalogue of large earthquakes presently available, with the most reliable parameters selected, duplications and fakes removed, and in some cases, new earthquakes discovered.\r\nFinally, the infrastructure consists of web software that allows the archive and catalogue to be stored, maintained, displayed and interrogated in an intuitive way, by means of easy-to-use web GIS tools.",

        "abstract_en": "This is the final report produced in the context of the GEM Strain Rate Project, one of the global components of the GEM Foundation. The project was charged to analyse and synthesize all available geodetic data in order to create a global data set of geodetic velocities that can be used to model plate motions and strain rates in plate boundary zones. To this end, we estimated 6533 velocities from position time-series that we derived from the analysis of RINEX data that was either freely available or made available to us specifically for this project. All but 15 of these velocities were used in the modelling. In a separate analysis, we also re- analysed all RINEX data in China and effectively added 1143 velocities to the data set. Finally, we added 13,318 velocities from 216 studies in the published literature (or from personal communications) to achieve a grand total of 20,979 velocities at 17,491 unique locations used in the modelling. Of all velocities, 16,325 are in plate boundary zones (as defined by us) and the remaining 4654 velocities are for points on, predefined, rigid tectonic plates or blocks. We created a global mesh that has 144,827 deforming cells of 0.2\u00b0 (latitudinal) by 0.25\u00b0 (longitudinal) dimension covering the plate boundary zones, with the remaining cells covering 50 rigid plates and blocks. For 36 of these plates, we estimated the rigid-body rotation from our data set, and the rotations of the remaining plates are taken from the literature. The rigid-body rotations are used as boundary conditions in the strain rate calculations. The strain rate field is modelled using the Haines and Holt method, which uses splines to obtain an interpolated velocity gradient tensor field, from which strain rates, vorticity rates, and expected velocities are derived. We also estimated model uncertainties, specific for this high-resolution mesh, which indicates that there still are many areas with large strain rate uncertainties where the data spacing is often much larger than the cell dimensions. Nevertheless, the model and data input are a tremendous improvement to the previous global strain rate model from 2004. All results are transferred to GEM and are also archived and displayed by a dedicated server hosted by UNAVCO (gsrm2.unavco.org), one of the project's partners. In addition, we created a kmz-layer of contour's of the second invariant of the model strain rates, and we created an online tool that would allow a user to upload his own velocities and plot them with the velocities in the GEM dataset in 53 different reference frames.",

The underlying assumption of this work is that the GMPEs selected in Task 3 are to be applied in subsequent GEM applications on a regional, as opposed to site-specific, scale. As a result of the regional-scale application, measurements of the relevant site parameters will not be available at the vast majority of locations where ground motions are to be estimated. Our work fills this gap by recommending correlation relationships that can produce statistical estimates of site parameters (median, standard deviation) conditional on information such as geologic and topographic conditions that are available for all, or most, global regions.\r\nChapter 1 of this report reviews a number of candidate GMPEs with specific emphasis on the site parameters employed in the models. This work clearly establishes that Vs30 is a required input parameter for global application. Basin depth is also a parameter used in some relations. Chapter 2 describes procedures for estimation of Vs30 from information such as geologic and geotechnical site classifications, topographic metrics, and Vs profile data shallower than 30 m. Chapter 3 describes procedures for estimation of basin depth and provides recommendations for utilizing these parameters in the GMPEs that require it. Chapter 4 summarizes the principal recommendations of this report.",

A variety of models are available, however, that modify GMPE predictions to account for directivity, or to capture polarization of response spectra in the near-fault region. In addition to standard GMPE parameters such as earthquake magnitude and distance, these models typically use the earthquake hypocenter location and possibly other information about slip direction to infer whether a given site is likely to experience directivity effects, and amplifies or de-amplifies the GMPE prediction appropriately. This report presents an overview of published methods for adjusting GMPEs to include directivity effects, as well as directionality effects that are sometimes considered to be related to near-fault effects. Recommendations for the use of these models were developed by surveying all published models of this type, noting the ground motion data sets used in their calibration and the range of seismological conditions for which they are valid (e.g., active crustal earthquakes versus subduction or stable continental earthquakes). These results are intended for use by the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) project.

The first stage of this process is a pre-selection from the over 300 empirical and simulation-based GMPEs that are currently available [Douglas, 2011] to retain a subset of the most recent and robust models. While making this pre-selection it is important to retain a sufficient number of models so that the potentially large epistemic uncertainty within the prediction of earthquakes ground motions (e.g., Douglas, [2010]) is recognised. Also, the GMPEs pre-selected in Task 2 will be further winnowed down in Task 3 of the project to retain the final selection proposed for use in the seismic hazard assessment of GEM. The purpose of this short report is to present a pre-selection of available models for all the seismotectonic regimes present on Earth. The selection criteria adopted in this study are consistent with the deliverables provided by Tasks 1a in terms of predictive parameters to use for ground- motion modelling and their proper ranges. The authors of this report partially benefitted from the experience gained in GMPEs pre-selection for SHARE [Douglas, 2009] and GEM1 [Douglas et al, 2009] projects.\r\n",

        "abstract_en": "This report documents the development and applications of the Building Taxonomy for the Global Earthquake\r\nModel (GEM). The purpose of the GEM Building Taxonomy is to describe and classify buildings in a uniform\r\nmanner as a key step towards assessing their seismic risk. Criteria for development of the GEM Building\r\nTaxonomy were that the Taxonomy be relevant to seismic performance of different construction types; be\r\ncomprehensive yet simple; be collapsible; adhere to principles that are familiar to the range of users; and\r\nultimately be extensible to non-buildings and other hazards. The taxonomy was developed in conjunction with\r\nother GEM researchers and builds on the knowledge base from other taxonomies, including the EERI and IAEE\r\nWorld Housing Encyclopedia, PAGER-STR, and HAZUS.\r\nThe taxonomy is organized as a series of expandable tables, which contain information pertaining to various\r\nbuilding attributes. Each attribute describes a specific characteristic of an individual building or a class of\r\nbuildings that could potentially affect their seismic performance. The following 13 attributes have been\r\nincluded in the GEM Building Taxonomy Version 2.0 (v2.0):\r\n1. direction\r\n2. material of the lateral load-resisting system\r\n3. lateral load-resisting system\r\n4. height\r\n5. date of construction or retrofit\r\n6. occupancy\r\n7. building position within a block\r\n8. shape of the building plan\r\n9. structural irregularity\r\n10. exterior walls\r\n11. roof\r\n12. floor\r\n13. foundation system.\r\nThe report illustrates the practical use of the GEM Building\r\nTaxonomy by discussing example case studies, in which the buildingspecific\r\ncharacteristics are mapped directly using GEM taxonomic\r\nattributes and the corresponding taxonomic string is constructed\r\nfor that building, with \u201c/\u201d slash marks separating attributes.",

The fault compilation tool has been designed for input of individual fault sections or folds and site-specific data. Guidelines for using the tool are presented as a series of illustrated steps in a workflow starting at entering traces through to generating fault sources, along with an additional optional step of entering observations at specific sites.",

In this context a parametric earthquake catalog for the region was compiled and homogenized to moment magnitude, Mw. The seismotectonic models proposed in the previous phase (RESIS-I) were revised and two seismogenic zonations proposed (see details below). After a comparison with local strong motion data (statistical analysis of residuals) a set of GMPEs associated with the tectonic regimes present in the region (active shallow crust, volcanic, subduction interface, and subduction intraslab) were defined. \r\nThe original seismic hazard calculation was made using CRISIS2007 code in a grid of 0.1 x 0.1 degrees (aprox 10 km), for return periods of 200, 1000, and 2500 years. As a result, maps in terms of peak ground acceleration (PGA) and spectral accelerations SA (T) for periods of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2s were obtained, as well as uniform hazard spectra (UHS) for six major cities of the region.",

The changes of water level in seas and oceans are the proof for that the Earth crust\u2019s deformations drift west. Water in oceans and seas flows from those places on Earth which rise to those which drop, on the principle of equalizing the hydrostatic level. The west drift of the Earth crust\u2019s deformations has been for millions of years now the reason of the continental drift and most of the tectonic processes of our planet.\r\nhttps://www.preventionweb.net/publications/view/20582",

Meinen ersten Vortrag 'Antriebsmechanismus der Plattentektonik' hatte ich im Jahre 1993 im Institut f\u00fcr Geophysik der Polnischen Akademie der Wissenschaften in Warschau abgehalten.\r\nDas fundamentale Problem in der Geophysik f\u00fcr eine plausible Erdbebenvohersage ist das richtige physikalische Modell der Erde und des Inneren der Erde, d.h. das richtige Modell des Antriebsmechanismus der Plattentektonik.\r\nSie arbeiten, sehr geehrte Herr Professor und auch die ganze Geophysik, vom Anfang an mit einem komplett falschen und unlogischem Modell, mit der sog. 'Mantelkonvektion'.\r\nDas was USGS als den vermeintlichen \"Antriebsmechanismus der Plattentektonik\" zeigt,\r\nder sog. 'Suppentopf', ist einfach lachhaft und peinlich f\u00fcr eine anst\u00e4ndige wissenschaftliche US-Institution.\r\n\r\nEnglish version:  https://www.academia.edu/48836915/CALTECH_USGS_Letter_to_Prof_Gurnis",

It was developed on the METEOR project (Ghosh et al., 2018) for 47 ODA (Official Development Assistance) countries, as determined by the OECD-DAC (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Development Assistance Committee). Without formal protocols for exposure development, risk management decisions in ODA countries may rely on loss modelling results suffering from less than adequate input data that may not be sufficient to address UN SDG and SFDRR targets and goals.\r\n--\r\nPlease see https://meteor-project.org/data/ to download the exposure data.\r\nInteractive maps of the exposure data are available from https://maps.meteor-project.org",
